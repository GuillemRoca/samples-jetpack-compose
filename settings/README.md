In a lot of applications, there will be some aspects that will be configurable via a setting. For these cases, we often want to allow users to configure these various settings from within the application itself. A common approach to this is providing a settings screen that displays the available settings to the user, along with allowing a way to interact with or toggle the assigned value for a specific setting.
